Let me show you the first <b>latte</b> art patent to learn if you're a beginner.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.000
The first thing is silky textured milk.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm doing mine today with a Nanofoamer Lithium to make sure that it's the right consistency for latte art.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.000
So, take your shot.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.000
Swirl your cup so that it mixes the crema and makes it smooth and workable.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.000
Then, tilt your cup on an angle towards you.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.000
The next stage is setting your canvas.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.000
To do this, pour in a thin stream from a few inches away.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.000
Your milk should fall through the crema, leaving you with a beautiful golden brown canvas on top.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.000
Once your cup is half to three-quarters full, it's time to make your art here.
